i'm writing this so i don't have to rely on something someone else made to convert markdown files i write into blog posts for my website. it's probably going to be jank and exclusively tailored to my use-case. hooray!

the plan is to take a folder of md files, reformat each one as html inside a blog post template and stick them in a destination folder. it also needs to update an index that contains a link to every post, because that's how I get a list of all posts to my preview script.
